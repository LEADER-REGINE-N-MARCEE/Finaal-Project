                feedback so we can work on improving our store and service. The selection of keyboards has expanded to over 30 brands, we are happy to be working with various brands such as Cannon keys, GMK, and VARMILO whom we meet frequently in person
                at events all around to world to keep our relationship strong with them, which is important in being able to select the best products for customers. We have also been offering Group-Buys since the launch of KEY.CORP but has never been
                the #1 focus as we want to make sure that we can offer all possible mechanical keyboards before bringing in crowd-funded projects.
